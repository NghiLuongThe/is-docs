      "brief": "Vulnerability and Asset Management (VAM) is an innovative web platform designed to streamline the process of managing and monitoring vulnerabilities across various assets and devices. VAM consolidates critical information from multiple trusted sources such as NVD (National Vulnerability Database), MITRE, CISA, Red Hat, Tenable, ... into one centralized location. This ensures that users have continuous access to accurate, up-to-date vulnerability data, even if individual sources are temporarily unavailable.",

      "brief": "A risk score is a quantitative metric used to evaluate the level of risk associated with a device within a network system. This score is determined based on various factors, including the device's critical functions, type of device, and the impact of known security vulnerabilities (CVE). Accurately assessing the risk score helps organizations prioritize their protection and remediation efforts.",

Unlike traditional vulnerability scoring systems like CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System), SSVC takes a contextual approach by focusing on factors that are particularly relevant to each organization. This results in a prioritization system that helps stakeholders address vulnerabilities according to the actual risk level and urgency relevant to their unique environment.",
